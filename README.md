# Mapping_Earthquakes



## Background

The 7-days earthquake data shows the locations of the earthquakes.  They are clustered around some areas with high frequencies.  It is instructional to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.  We will add a layer of the tectonic plates.  We also will generate a layer for the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map and a dark background tile layer.



## Results
